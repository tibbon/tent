tent
====

You're a general in a tent. You don't an omniscient view of the battlefield. You get reports from your troops and can direct the strategy to win the battle. 

Oh, and things don't happen instantly. And sometimes the reports you get back aren't so accurate- sometimes grossly so. 

Soon to be playable multi-player or against the computer.
